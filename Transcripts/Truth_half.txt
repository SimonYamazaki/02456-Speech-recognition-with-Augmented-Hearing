Physics is one of the most fundamental of the sciences. Scientists of all disciplines use the ideas of physics, including chemists who study the structure of molecules, paleontologists who try to reconstruct how dinosaurs walked, and climatologists who study how human activities affect the atmosphere and oceans.  Physics is also the foundation of all engineering and technology. No engineer could design a flat-screen TV, an interplanetary spacecraft, or even a better mousetrap without first understanding the basic laws of physics. The study of physics is also an adventure. You will find it challenging, sometimes frustrating, occasionally painful, and often richly rewarding. If you have ever wondered why the sky is blue, how radio waves can travel through empty space, or how a satellite stays in orbit, you can find the answers by using fundamental physics.  You will come to see physics as a towering achievement of the human intellect in its quest to understand our world and ourselves. In this opening chapter, we will go over some important preliminaries that we will need throughout our study. We will discuss the nature of physical theory and the use of idealized models to represent physical systems. We will introduce the systems of units used to describe physical quantities and discuss ways to describe the accuracy of a number.  We will look at examples of problems for which we canâ€™t find a precise answer, but for which rough estimates can be useful and interesting. Finally, we will study several aspects of vectors and vector algebra.  Vectors will be needed throughout our study of physics to describe and analyze physical quantities, such as velocity and force, that have direction as well as magnitude.  Physics is an experimental science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns that relate these phenomena. These patterns are called physical theories or, when they are very well established and widely used, physical laws or principles
