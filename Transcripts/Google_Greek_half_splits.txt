Basics is one of the most fundamental of the scientist scientist of all this Appliance easy ideas of physics including chemist who study the structure of molecules who tried to reconstruct how Dennis are swelled and kemetology to study how human activities affect the atmosphere and ocean. // 

B6 is also the foundation of all engineering and Technology. No engineer who designed a flat screen TV and interplanetary spacecraft or even a better mousetrap without face understanding to basic laws of physics. // 

The study of physics is also an adventure. You will find it challenging sometimes frustrating occasionally painful and Retreat the working // 

if you have ever wondered why the sky is blue how radio waves can travel through empty space or how is satellite space in orbit. You can find the answers by using fundamental physics. // 

You will come to see faces as a towering achievement of all human intellect in his guests understand our world and ourselves // 

in this opening chapter. We will go with important preliminary that we will need throughout our study. We will discuss the nature of this Cafe Ori and the use of idolized models to represent physical systems. // 

We will introduce the system of units used to describe and discuss ways to describe the accuracy of a number. // 

We will look at examples of problems for which we can find a precise answer, but for which route estimate can be useful and interesting. // 

Finally. We will study investor algebra.  Masters will be needed for our study of physics to describe and analyze physical quantities that have direction as well as magnitude. // 

Physics is an experimental science Basics observe the phenomena of Nature and try to find patterns that relate these phenomena are called physical Theory or when they are very well established and widely used physical laws or principles.
