Physics is one of the most fundamental of Sciences scientist of old disciplines use the ideas of physics including chemists who study the structure of molecules paleontologist who try to reconstruct how dinosaurs walk and climatologists to study how human activities affect the atmosphere and oceans. // 

Physics is also the foundation of all engineering and Technology. No engineer could design a flat screen TV and interplanetary spacecraft or even a better mousetrap without first understanding the basic laws of physics. // 

The study of physics is also an adventure. You will find it challenging sometimes frustrating occasionally painful and open richly rewarding. // 

If you have ever wondered why the sky is blue how radio waves can travel through empty space or how a satellite stays in orbit. You can find the answers by using fundamental physics // 

You will come to see physics as a towering achievement of the human intellect in its quest to understand our world and ourselves. // 

In this opening chapter, we will go over some important preliminaries that we will need throughout our study. We will discuss the nature of physical Theory and the use of idealized models to represent physical systems. // 

We will introduce systems of units used to describe physical quantities and discuss ways to describe the accuracy of numbers. // 

We will look at examples of problems for which we cannot find a precise answer, but for which rough estimates can be useful and interesting. // 

Finally, we will study several aspects of Victor's and Victor algebra. Victor's will be needed throughout our study of physics to describe and analyze physical quantities such as velocity and force that have direction as well as magnitude. // 

Physics is an experimental science physicist observed the phenomena of Nature and try to find patterns that relate these phenomena. These patterns are called physical Theory or when they are very well-established and widely used physical lost or principals. // 

To develop a physical Theory a physicist has to learn to ask appropriate questions design experiments to try answer the questions and draw a appropriate conclusions from the results. // 

Legend has it that Galileo Galilei dropped light and heavy objects from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa to find out whether the rates of fall were the same or different. From examining the results of his experiments he made the inductive leap to the principal or theory that the acceleration of a falling body is independent of its weight. // 

The development of physical theories such as Galileo's often take an indirect path with blind La wrong guesses and the discarding of unsuccessful theories in favor of more promising ones. // 

Physics is not simply a collection of facts and principles. It is also the process by which we arrive at general principles that describe how the physical Universe behaves. // 

No theory is ever regarded as the final of ultimate truth. The possibility always exists that new observations will require that a theory be revised or discarded.  // 

It is in the nature of physical theory that we can disprove a theory by finding behavior that is inconsistent with it, but we can never prove that a theory is always correct getting back to Cali Leo suppose. We drop a feather and a cannonball. // 

They certainly do not fall at the same rate. This does not mean that getting there was wrong. It means that this theory is incomplete if we dropped the feather and the cannonball in a vacuum to eliminate the effects of then they do fall at the same rate. // 

Galileo's theory has a change of validity it applies only to objects for which the force exerted by the air is much less than the weight of like feathers or parachutes are clearly outside this range // 

Alton a new development in physics extend a principles range of validity Galileo's analysis of falling bodies was greatly extended have a century later by Newton's laws of motion and law of gravitation.
