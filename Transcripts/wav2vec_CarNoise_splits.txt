PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF SCIENCIS SCIENTIST OF OLD DISCIPLINES USE THE IDEAS OF PHYSICS INCLUDING CHEMISTS WHOE STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF MOLECUTES PELENTOLOGISTS WHO TRY TO RECONSTRUCT HOW DYNASAS WALKED AND CLEMETOLOGISTS WHO STUDY HOW HUMAN ACTIVITIES AFFICT THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEANS // PHYSICS IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF ALL ENGINEERING AND TICNOLOGY NO ENGINEER COULD DESIGN A FLES CREEN TEVE AND INTERPLANETARY SPACECRAFT OR EVEN A BIT AMOUSETRAP WITHOUT FIRST UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS // THE STUDY OF PHYSICS IS ALSO AN ADVENTURE YOU WILL FIND IT CHALLENGING SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING OCCASIONALLY PAINFUL AND OFTEN RICHLY REWARDING // IF YOU HAVE EVER WONDERED WHY THE SKY IS BLUE HOW RADIO WAVES CAN TRAVEL THROUGH EMPTY SPACE OR HOW A SEBTLE IE STAYES IN ORBIT YOU CAN FIND THE AINSAS BY USING FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS // YOU WILL COME TO SEE PHYSICS AS A TOWERING ACHIEVEMENT OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT IN ITS QUIT TO UNDERSTAND OUR WORLD AND OURSELVES // IN THIS OPENING CHAPTER WE WILGO OVER SOME IMPORTANT PRELIMINARIES THAT WE WILL NEED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY WE WILL DISCUSS THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY AND THE USE OF IDEALIZED MUDLS TO REPRESENT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS // WE WILL INTRODUCE SYSTEMS OF UNITS USE TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND DISCUSS WASTE TO DESCRIBE THE ACCURACY OF NUMBERS // WE WILL LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS FOR WHICH WE CANNOT FIND A PRECISE ANSWER BUT FOR WHICH ROUGH ESTIMATES CAN BE USEFUL AND INTERESTING // FINALLY WE WILL STUDY SEVERAL ESPECTS OF VICTORS AND VICTOR EL GIBRA VICTOS WILL BE NEEDED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY OF PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYZED PHYSICAL QUANTITIES SUCH AS VELOCITY AND FALSE THAT HAVE DIRECTION AS WELL AS MAGNITUDE // PHYSICS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE PHYSICIST OBSERVED THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE AND TRID TO FIND PEDANTS THAT RELATE THESE PHENOMENA THESE PEDANTS ARE CALLED PHYSICAL THEORIES OR WHEN THEY ARE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED AND WIDELY USED PHYSICAL LAWS OR PRINCIPLES // TO DEVELOP A PHYSICAL THEORY A PHYSIST HAS TO LEARN TO ASK APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS TO TRY ANSO THE QUESTIONS AND DRAW APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RESULTS // LEGEND HAZARD THAT GELILEO GELILE DROPPED LIGHT AND HEAVY OBJECTS FROM THE TOP OF THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEIR RATES OF FALL WERE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT FROM EXAMINING THE RESULTS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS HE MADE THE INDUCTIVE LEAP TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THEORY THAT THE EXLERATION OF A FALLING BODY IS INDEPENDENT OF ITS WEIGHT // THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL THEORIES SUCH AS CALILES OFTEN TAKE AN INDIRECT PATH WITH BLIND ELLEES WRONG GUESSES AND THE DISCARDING OF UNSUCCESSFUL THEORIES IN FAVOR OF MORE PROMISING ONES // PHYSICS IS NOT SINGLY A COLLECTION OF FECTS AND PRINCIPLES IT IS ALSO THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE ARRIVE AT GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT DESCRIBE HOW THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE BEHAVES // NO THEORY IS EVER REGARDED AS THE FINAL OR ULTIMATE TRUTH THE POSSIBILITY ALWAYS EXISTS THAT NEW OBSERVATIONS WILL REQUIRE THAT A THEORY BE REVISED OF THIS CODET // IT IS IN THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY THAT WE CAN DISPROVE A THEORY BY FINDING BEHAVIOUR THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH IT BUT WE CAN NEVER PROVE THAT A THEORY IS ALWAYS CORRECT GETTING BACK TO GELILEO SUPPOSE WE DROP A FEATHER AND A CANNON BOWL // THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT FALL AT THE SAME RATE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT GELIDEO WAS WRONG IT MEANS THAT HIS THEORY IS INCOMPLETE IF WE DROP THE FEATHER AND THE CANNON BALL IN A VECUUM TO ILLUMINATE THE EFFECTS OF AIR THEN THEY DO FALL AT THE SAME RATE // GELILEOS THEORY HAS A CHANGE OF VALIDITY IT APPLIES ONLY TO OBJECTS FOR WHICH THE FORCE EXERTED BY THE AIR IS MUCH LESS THAN THE WEIGHT OBJECTS LIKE FEATHERS OR PARACHUTES ARE CLEARLY OUTSIDE THIS RANGE // OFTEN A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PHYSICS EXTEND A PRINCIPLE'S RANGE OF FALIDITY GELILEOS ANELYSIS OF FALLING BUDIES WAS GREATLY EXTENDED HALF A CENTURY LATER BY NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION AND LAW OF GIRVATATION
