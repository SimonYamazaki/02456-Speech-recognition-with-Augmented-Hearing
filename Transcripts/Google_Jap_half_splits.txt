physically is one of the most fundamental of the Sciences scientist of all the disciplines used the ideas of a physics including a chemist who studies the structure of the molecule is it paid in total just try to reconstruct the how dinosaurs walk through and climatologists to study how human activities that affect the atmosphere and the oceans //  Physics is also the foundation of engineering and Technology. No engineer could to design a flat screen TV and interplanetary spacecraft or even a better mousetrap to without first understanding of the basic laws of physics. //  The study of physics is also an adventure. You will find it too challenging. Sometimes you put a strange thing occasionally painful and often richly rewarded //  if you've ever wondered why the sky is blue how radio waves can travel through empty space or how a satellite to stays in Obito. You can find out the answer by using fundamental physics //  You will come to see physics as a towering achievement of the human intellect in its quest to understand that our world and our service. //  Images of opening chapter we will go over impotent on preliminaries that we will need to throw out of our study. We will discuss the nature of physical Theory and use of idealized models to represent or physical systems. //  We will introduce the systems are over units use it to describe the physical quantities and the discussed ways to describe the accuracy of a number. //  We will look at the examples of problems for which we can't find a precise answer but for which it rough estimates can be useful and interesting. //  Finally, we will study several aspects over vectors and vector algebra vectors will be needed to throughout our study of physics to describe and analyze physical quantities such as velocity and force that to have a direction as well as Magneto. //  Physics is an experimental science scientist observed phenomena of Nature and the try to find the patterns that relate. Diesel phenomena. These patents physical theories or when they are very well established and widely used to physical laws or principles.
