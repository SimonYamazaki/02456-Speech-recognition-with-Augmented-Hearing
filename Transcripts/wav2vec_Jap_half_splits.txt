PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE MOST OF FUNDAMENTAL OF THE SCIENCES SCIENTISTS OF ALL THE DISCIPLINES USE THE IDEAS OF PHYSICS INCLUDING CHEMISTS WHO STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF THE MULTECURES PADIANTOLOGISTS WHO TORY TO RECONSTRUCT HAWDINES OR THE WACTO AND CRIMETOLOGISTS WO STUDY HOW HUMAND ACTIVITIES EFFECT TO ATMOSPHERE UNDER OSIAND //  PHYSICS IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF THE ENGINEERING AND TECNOLOGY NO ENGINEER COULD TO DESIGN A FLATOSCREN TIVI AN INTERPLANETARY SPASEOCRAPTO OR EVEN EPETAMOUSOTRAP WITHOUT FIRST OR UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS //  THE STUDY OF PHYSICS IS ALSO AN ADVENTURE YOU WILL FIND IT TO CHALLENGING SOMETIMES THE FURASTERINTIN OCCASIONALLY PAINFUL AND OFTEN LITERALLY REWARDING //  IF YOU HAVE EVER WONDERED WHY THE SKY IS BLUE HOW RADIO WAVES CAN TRAVEL THROUGH EMPTY SPACES OR HOW A SATURLITER STAYS IN OR BITTER YOU CAN FIND THE ANSWERS BY USING FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS //  YOU WILL COME TO SEE PHYSICS AS A TOWERING ACHIEVEMENT OF HUMAN INTELLECT IN ITS CREST OR TWO UNDERSTAND OUR WILDER AND OURSELVES //  IN THIS OPENING CHAPTER WE WILL GO OVER IMPORTANT ON PRELIMINARIES THAT WE WILL NEEDE THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY WE WILL DISCUSS THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY AND THE USE OF IDEALIZED MODELS TO REPURESENTO PHYSICAL SYSTEMS // WE WILL INTRODUCE THE SYSTEMS OFER UNITS USE TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND  DISCUSS WAYS TO DESCRIBE THE ACCURACY OVE OUR NUMBER // WE WILL LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS FOR WHICH WE CAN TO FIND A PRECISE ANSWER BUT FOR WHICH E LOF ESTIMATES CAN BE USEFUL AND INTERESTING //  FINALLY WE WILL STUDY SEVERAL ASPECTS OVER VICTORS AND VICTOR EL GEBRAN VICTORS WILL BE NEEDED TO THROUGH OUT O OUR STUDY OVER PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE UNDER ANALYZE THE PHYSICAL COANTITIES SUCH AS VELOSITY AND THE FORCE THAT TO HAVE DIRECTION AS WELL AS MAGNITUDO // HYSICS IS AN EXPERIMENTARY SCIENCE SCIENTISTS OBSERVE TE PHENOMENA OFER NATURE AND THE TRY TO FIND E PATERNS THAT RELATE THESE U PHENOMENA THESE PATERNS ARE CALLE TO PHYSICAL THEORIES OR WHEN THEY ARE BEDI WELL ESTABLISH AND WIDELY USED TO PHYSICAL LAWS OR PORINTICALS
