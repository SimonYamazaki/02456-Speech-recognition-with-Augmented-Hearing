PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF SCIENCISTS SCIENCISTS OF OLOGISIPWANDS U STHE IDEAS OF FHYSICS INCUDING CHEMISTS WHO STUDY THE STRUCTURE MOLOCULES THE MYTOLOGISTS WHO TRY TO RECONSTRUCT HOW DYNAS'S WARTH AND THE MYTOLOGISTS WHO STUDY HOW HUMAN ATIVITIES OF FICT THE ETMOSPHE ANDAN VOTIONS // PHYSICS IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF OLL ENGENEERING AND SYCNOLOGIS NO ENGINEER COULD DESIGN OF LESS PREEN TEB AND INTERPLANETARY SPACECRASS OR EVEN A BIT A MOSPRECT WITHOUT FIRST UNDESTAYNIN THE BASIC LOWES OF PHYSICS // THE STUDY OF PHYSICS IS ALSO AN ADVENTURE YOU WILL FIND IT CHALLENGING SOMETIMES TRUSTRATING OCCASIONALLY PAINFUL AND OFTEN RICHLY REWARDING // IF YOU HAVE EBER WONDERED WHY THE SKY IS BLUE HOW RADIO WAVES CAN TREVEL THLOUGH EMPTY SPACE OR HOW A SUBTLE ITE SPACE IN ORBIT TO CONFINE THE ANSAS BY USE IN FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS // YOU WILL COME TO SEE PHYSICS AS A TOWERING ACHIEVEMENT OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT IN ITS TWIST TO UNDERSTAND OUR WORLD AND OURSELVES // IN THIS OPENING CHAPTER WE WILL GO OVER SOME IMPORTANT PRELIMINARIES THAT WE WILL NEED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY WE WILL DISCUSS THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY AND THE USE OF IDEALIZED MUDDELS TO REPRESENT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS // WE WILL INTRODUCE SYSTEMS OF UNITS USE TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND DISCUSS WAYSE TO DESCRIBE THE ACCURACY OF NUMBUS // WE WILL LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS FOR WEEKS WE CAN NOT FIND A PRECISE ANSWER BUT FOR WHICH ROUGH ESTIMATES CAN BE USEFUL AND INTERESTING // FINALLY WE WILL STUDY SEVERAL ESPICTS OF VICTORS AND VICTOR ELGIBRAM VICTUS WILL BE NEEDED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY OF PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYZED PHYSICAL QUANTITIES SUCH AS WELOCITY AND FALSE THAT HAVE DIRECTION AS WELL AS MAGNITUDE // PHYSICS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE PHYSICIS OBSERVE THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE AND TRY TO FIND PEDANTS THAT RELATE THESE PHENOMENA THESE PEDANTS ARE CALLED PHYSICAL THEORIES OR WHEN THEY ARE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED AND WIDELY USED PHYSICAL LAWS OF PRINCIPLES // TO DEVELOP A PHYSICAL THEORY A PHYSIST HAS TO LEARN TO ASK APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS DESIGN EXPERIMENTS TO TRY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND DRAW APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS FROM THE PRESATS // LIGEND HAZART THAT GELILEO GELILE DROPP NIGHT AND HEAVY OBJECTS FROM THE TUP OF THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEIR RATES OF FALL WERE THE SAME OBJERS FROM EXAMINING THE RESULTS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS HE MADE THE INDUCTIV LEAD TO THE PRINCIPLE OR THEORY THAT THE EXHELERATION OF AFFALLING VALY IS INDEPENDENT OF ITS SPATE // THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL THEORIES SUCH AS CELIBES OFTEN TAKE AND INDIRECT PATH WITH BLIND ELES DRONG GUESSES AND THE DISCARDING OF UNSUCCESSFUL THEORIES AN FAVOR OF MORE PROMISING ONCS // PHYSICS IS NOT SIMPLY A CONVICTION OF FECTS AND PRINCIPLES IT IS ALSO THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE ARRIVE AT GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT DESCRIBE HOW THE PHYSICAL UNIVALSITEPADS // NO THEORY IS EVER REGARDED AS THE FINAL OR ULTIMATE TRUTH THE POSSIBILITY ALWAYS EXISTS THAT NEW OBSERVATIONS WILL REQUIRE THAT A THEORY ADVISED OF THIS COTTAGE // IT IS IN THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY THAT WE CAN DISPROVE A THEORY BY FINDING BEHAVIOUR THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH IT BUT WE CAN NEVER PROVE THAT A THEORY IS ALWAYS QIT GETTING FECTOCAN NAIL SUPPOSED WE DRUP A FEATHER AND A CANBLE // THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT FOLL AT THE SAME RATE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT GELLEE WAS WRONG IT MEANS THAT HIS TEORY IS INCOMPLETE IF WE DROP THE FEATHER AND THE CANOPOLD IN A VECUAN TO ELUMINATE THE EFFIX OF ARE THEN THEY TO FOLD AT THE SAME RATE // GELLILEOS THEORY HAS A CHANGE OF E LEDIATY TAT APPLIES ONLY TO OBJECTS FOR WHICH THE FORCE EXERTED BY THE AIR IS MUCH LESS THAN THE WEIGHT OBJECTS LIKE FEATHERS OR PARASHUTES ARE CLEARLY OUTSIDE THIS RANGE // OFTEN A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PHYSICS EXTENT A PRINCIPLES RANGE OF POLLEGITIES GELLILEO'S ANELYSIS OF FALLING BUDIES WAS GREATLY EXTENDED HALF A CENTURY LATER BY NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION AND LAW OF GIRVITATION
