BASICS IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF THE SCIENCES SCIENTISTS OF ALL DISIPPLINES USY IDEAS OF PHYSICS INCLUDING CHEMISTS WHO STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF MOLECUSE PALEODOLOGISTS WHO TRIED TO RECONSTRUCT HOWND ANISON'S WORLD AND CHIMATOLOGISTS WHO STUDY HOW HUMAN ACTIVITIES ARTECT THE ATMOSPHERE ENNOTIONS //  PHYSICS IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF ALL ENGINEERING ATENOLOGY NO ENGINEER COULD DESIGN A FLOOD SCREEN TO THE AN INTERPLANETARY SPACECRAT OR EVEN A BETTER MOUSE TRAP WITHOUT FIRST UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC LOWS OF PHYSICS //  THE STUDY OF PHYSICS IS ALSO UNADVENTURE YOU WILL FIND IT CHALLENGING SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING OCCASIONALLY PAINFUL AND OFTEN RICHY REWARDING //  IF YOU HAVE EVER WANDER WHY THE SKY IS BLUE HOW READYO WAVES CAN TRABLE THROUGH EMPTY SPACE OR HOW ISUTERLIGHT STAYS IN OUR BID YOU CAN FIND THE ANSWERS BY USING FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS //  YOU WILL COME TO SEE PHYSICS AS A TOWERING ACHIEVEMEN OF ALL HUMAN INTELLECT IT IS CERSE TO UNDERSTAND OUR WORD AND OURSELVES //  IN THIS OPENIN CHAPTER WE WILL GO OVER SOME IMPORTANT PRELIMINARIES THAT WE WILL NEED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY WE WILL DISCUSS THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY AND THE USE OF IDALIZED MONTALS TO REPRISENT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS //  WE WILL INTRODUCE THE SYSTEMS OF UNITS USED TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND DISCUSS WAYS TO DESCRIBE THE ACCURACY OF A NUMBER //  WE WILL LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS FOR WHICH WE CAN FIND A PRESISE ANSWER BUT FOR WHICH ROUF ESTIMATES CAN BE USEFUL AND INTERESTING //  FINALLY WE WILL STUDY SEVERAL ASPECTS OF VETORS AND VECTORALGEBRA BECTORS WILL BE NEEDED TOUR STUDY OF PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYZE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES SUCH AS VELOCITY AND FORCE THAT HAVE DIRECTION AS WELL AS MAGNITUDE //  PHYSICS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE PHYSICS OBSERVE THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE AND TRY TO FIND PARDENS THAT RELATE THIS PHENOMENA THESE PARDONS ARE CALLED PHYSICAL THEORIES OR WHEN THEY ARE VERY WELL ESTAMBLISHED AND WIDELY USED PHYSICAL LAWS OR PRINCIPLES
