PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTALY OF SCIENCES SCIENTISTS OF OLD DISCIPLINES USE THE IDEAS OF PHYSICS INCLUDING CHEMISTS WHO STUDY THE STRUCT OF MOLECULES HATELINTELOGISTS WO TRY TO RECONSTRUCT HOW DYNASIS BOLK AND CLIMBATOLOGISTS WHO STUDY HOW HUMAN ACTIVITIES AFFICTHE ATMOSPHERE AND OTEANS // PHYSICS IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF ALL SLUERING AND TIGNOLOGY NO INGENEER COULD DESIGN A FLAT SCREEN C B AND INSURPLANETARY SPACECRAFT OR EVEN A BIT A MOUSETRAP WITHOUT FIRST UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS // THE STUDY OF PHYSICS IS ULTER AND ADVENTURE YOU WILL FIND AT TELLING TING SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING OCCASIONALLY PAINFUL AND OFTEN RICHLY REWARDING // IF YOUVE EVER WONDERED WHY THE SKY IS BLUE HOW RADIO GRAVES CAN TRAVEL THROUGH EMPTY SPACE AHOW A SETELIZED STATE AND OFBIT YOU CAN FIND THE ANSWERS BY USING FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS // YOU WILL COME TO SEE PHYSICS AS A TOWERING ACHIEVEMENT OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT IN ITS QUEST TO UNDERSTAND OUR WORLD AND OURSELVES // IN THIS OPENING CHAPTER WELL GO OVER SOME IMPORTANT PRELIMINARIES THAT WE WILL NEED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY WE WILL DISCUSS THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY AND USE OF IDEALIZED MODELS TO REPRESENT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS // WE WILL INTRODUCE THE SYSTEMS OF UNITS USE TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND DISGUSS WAYS TO DESCRIBE THE ACCURACY OF ANOMTHER // WELL LOOTE AT EXAMPLES OF PROPLEMS FOR WHICH WE CAN FIND A PRECISE ANSWER BUT FOR WHICH ROUGH ESTIMATES CAN BE USEFUL AND INTERESTING // FINALLY WE WILL STUDY SEVERAL ESPECTS OF VICTORS AND VICTOR ELGEBRA VICTORS WILL BE NEEDED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY OF PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYZE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES SUCH AS VELOCITY AND FORCE THAT HAVE DIRECTION AS WELL AS MAGNITUDE // PHYSICS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE PHYSICISTS OBSERVED THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE AND TRY TO FIND PETENITS THAT RELATE THESE PHENOMENA THESE PETENTS ARE CALLED PHYSICAL THEORIES ALL WHEN THEY ARBERI WELL ESTABLISHED AND BIDELY YOUTHD PHYSICAL LAWS ALL PRINCIPLES // TO DEVELOP A PHYSICAL THEORY A PHYSICIST HAS TO LEARN TO ASK APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS TE SIGN EXPERIMENTS TO TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND DRAW APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RESULTS // LEGEND HAZ IRT THAT GALILEO GALILE DROPPED LIGHT AND HEAVY OBJECTS FROM THE TOP OF THE LEANING TOWER OF PIZA TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEIR RATS OF FALL WERE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT FROM EXAMINING THE RESULTS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS HE MADE THE INDUCTIVE LEAVE TO THE PRINCIPLE OL THEORY THAT THE EXHOLERATION OF A FALLING BODY IS INDEPENDENT OF ITS REIGT // THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL THEORIES SUCH AS GELILEOS OFTEN TAKTES AN INDIRECT PATH WITH LYING ELLEYS WRONG GUEZES AND THE TISCARDING OF UNSUCCESSFUL THEORIES IN FAVOUR OF MORE PROMISING ONES // PHYSICS IS NOT SIMPLY A COLLECTION OF FECTS AND PRINCIPLES IT IS ALSO THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE ARRIVE AT GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT DESCRIBE HOW THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE BEHAVES // NO THEORY IS EVER REGARDED AS THE FINAL OR ULTIMATE TRUTH THE POSSIBILITY ALWAYS EXISTS THAT NEW OBSERVATIONS WILL REQUIRE THAT A THEORY BE REVISED OR DISCARDED // IT IS IN THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY THAT WE CAN DISPROVE A THEORY BY FINDING BEHAVIOUR THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH IT BUT WE CAN NEVER PROVE THAT A THEORY IS ALWAYS CORRECT GETTING BACK TO GELILEO SUPPOSE WE DROP A FEATHER AN A CANNON BALL // THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT FALL AT THE SAME RATE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT GELILEO WAS WRONG IT MEANS THAT HIS THEORY WAS INCOMPLETE IF WE DROP THE FEATHER AND THE CANNON BALL IN A VACUUM TO ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF THE AIR THEN THEY DO FALL AT THE SAME RATE // GELILEO'S THEORY HAS HA RANGE OF THELIDITENT IT APPLIES ONLY TO OBJECTS FOR WHICH THE FORCE EXERTED BY THE AIR IS MUCH LESS THAN THE WEIGHT OBJECTS LIKE FEATHERS OR PARACHUTES ARE CLEARLY OUTSIDE THIS RANGE // OFTEN A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PHYSICS EXTENDS ITS PRINCIPLES RANGE OF VALIDITY GELLILIOS ANELYSES OF FALLING BODIES WAS GREATLY EXTENDED HALF A CENTURY LATER BY MEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION AND LAW OF REPUTATION
