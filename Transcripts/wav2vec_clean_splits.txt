PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF SCIENCISTS SCIENTIST OF OLD DISCIPLINES USE THE IDEAS OF PHYSICS INCLUDING CHEMISTS WHO STUDIED THE STRUCTURE OF MOLECULES PILENTOLOGISTS WHO TRY TO RECONSTRUCT HOW DYNASAS WALKED AND CLEMETOLOGISTS WHO STUDY HOW HUMAN ACTIVITIES AFFICT THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEANS //  PHYSICS IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF ALL ENGINEERING AND TYGNOLOGY NO ENGINEER COULD DESIGN A FLESE CREEN T V AND INTERPLANETARY SPACECRAFT OR EVEN A BIT A MOUSETRAP WITHOUT FIRST UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS // THE STUDY OF PHYSICS IS ALSO AN ADVENTURE YOU WILL FIND IT CHALLENGING SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING OCCASIONALLY PAINFUL AND OFTEN RICHLY REARDING // IF YOU HAVE EVER WONDERED WHY THE SKY IS BLUE HOW RADIO WAVES CAN TRAVEL THROUGH EMPTY SPACE OR HOW A SETELITE STAYS IN ORBIT YOU CAN FIND THE AINSAS BY USING FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS //  YOU WILL COME TO SEE PHYSICS AS A TOWERING ACHIEVEMENT OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT IN ITS QUIS TO UNDERSTAND OUR WORLD AND OURSELVES //  IN THIS OPENING CHAPTER WE WILLGOOVER SOME IMPORTANT PRELIMINARIES THAT WE WILL NEED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY WE WILL DISCUSS THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY AND THE USE OF IDEALIZED MUDDLES TO REPRESENT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS //  WE WILL INTRODUCE SYSTEMS OF UNITS USE TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND DISCUSS WAYS TO DESCRIBE THE ACCURACY OF NUMBERS //  WE WILL LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS FOR WHICH WE CAN NOT FIND A PRECISE ANSWER BUT FOR WHICH ROUGH ESTIMATES CAN BE USEFUL AND INTERESTING //  FINALLY WE WILL STUDY SEVERAL ESPECTS OF VICTORS AND VICTOR ELGIBRA VICTOS WILL BE NEEDED THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY OF PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYZED PHYSICAL QUANTITIES SUCH AS VELACITY AND FALSE THAT HAVE DIRECTION AS WELL AS MAGNITUDE //  PHYSICS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE PHYSICIST OBSERVED THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE AND TRI TO FIND PEDANTS THAT RELATE THESE PHENOMENA THESE PEDANTS ARE CALLED PHYSICAL THEORIES OR WHEN THEY ARE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED AND WIDELY USED PHYSICAL LAWS OR PRINCIPLES //  TO DEVELOP A PHYSICAL THEORY A PHYSIST HAS TO LEARN TO ASK APPROPRIATE QHUISTIONS DESIGN EXPERIMENTS TO TRY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND DRAW APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RESULTS //  LIGEND HAZARD THAT GELILEO GELILE DROPPED LIGHT AND HEAVY OBJECTS FROM THE TOP OF THE LEANING TOWER OF PESA TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEIR RATES OFFALL WERE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT FROM EXAMINING THE RESULTS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS HE MADE THE INDUCTIVE LEAP TO THE PRINCIPLE OR THEORY THAT THE EXCHLERATION OF A FALLING BODY IS INDEPENDENT OF ITS WEIGHT //  THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL THEORIES SUCH AS GELILEOS OFTEN TAKE AN INDIRECT PATH WITH BLIND ELIES WRONG GESUS AND THE DISCARDING OF UNSUCCESSFUL THEORIES IN FAVOUR OF MORE PROMISING ONES //  PHYSICS IS NOT SIMPLY A COLLECTION OF FECTS AND PRINCIPLES IT IS ALSO THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE ARRIVE AT GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT DESCRIBE HOW THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE BEHAVES //  NO THEORY IS EVER REGARDED AS THE FINAL OR ULTIMATE TRUTH THE POSSIBILITY ALWAYS EXISTS THAT NEW OBSERVATIONS WILL REQUIRE THAT A THEORY BE REVISED OF //  THIS CADET IT IS IN THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL THEORY THAT WE CAN DISPROVE A THEORY BY FINDING BEHAVIOUR THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH IT BUT WE CAN NEVER PROVE THAT A THEORY IS ALWAYS CORRECT GETTING BACK TO GELILEO SUPPOSE WE DROP A FEATHER AND A CANNON BALL // THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT FALL AT THE SAME RATE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT GELILEO WAS WRONG IT MEANS THAT HIS THEORY IS INCOMPLETE IF WE DROP THE FEATHER AND THE CANNON BALL IN A VACUUM TO ILLIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF AIR THEN THEY DO FALL AT THE SAME RATE //  GELILIOS THEORY HAS A CHANGE OF VALIDITY IT APPLIES ONLY TO OBJECTS FOR WHICH THE FORCE EXERTED BY THE AIR IS MUCH LESS THAN THE WEIGHT OBJECTS LIKE FEATHERS OR PARACHUTES ARE CLEARLY OUTSIDE THIS RANGE //  OFTEN A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PHYSICS EXTEND A PRINCIPLE'S RANGE OF VALIDITY GELILEOS ANNELYSIS OF FALLING BODIES WAS GREATLY EXTENDED HALF A CENTURY LATER BY NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION AND LAW OF GIVITATION
